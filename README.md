# wordle-in-python-for-fun-
I followed a tutorial on youtube to replicate wordle in python and added some of my own tweaks and features (youtube link in README)

Most of the game concept and logic is the same as the tutorial 
I made my own word filter and chose my own word list 
I also added the keyboard display feature for quality-of-life changes

This is just a project for python education and fun, no copyright infringment intended
Feel free to follow the tutorial link and make your own changes to the game!
